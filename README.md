# Kattis

This is where I keep my solutions to problems on open.kattis.com. A solution's filename, minus the extension, is identical to the problem ID of the problem it solves. Problems can be found at open.kattis.com/problems/[problem-id]. Some of these were done during timed competitions.

## Records

As of 23 September 2020:
* Fastest Python 3 solution to muddyhike
* 10th fastest Python 3 solution to milestones

Solution speed records can be found at open.kattis.com/problems/[problem-id]/statistics.
